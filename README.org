[[./out/demo-image.png]]

*** Setup
Note: An installation of `python3` is required.

If you have the `make` command-line tool installed, just run
#+begin_src
make setup
make random-walk
#+end_src
from your shell. If not, navigate into `./bin` and run
#+begin_src
./setup
./random-walk
#+end_src

A live `pyplot` figure should open up.
