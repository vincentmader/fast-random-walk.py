* Live Visualization of 2D Random-Walk

[[./out/demo-image.png]]

*** Setup
Note: An installation of `python3` is required.

If you have the `make` command-line tool installed, just run
#+begin_src
make setup
#+end_src
from your shell. If not, navigate into `./bin` and run
#+begin_src
./setup
#+end_src

*** Execution
Once again, if you DO have `make`, run
#+begin_src
make random-walk
#+end_src
If you don't not, navigate into `./bin` and execute
#+begin_src
./random-walk
#+end_src
from `./bin`.
A live `pyplot` figure should open up.
